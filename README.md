# RELATIONSHIP-BETWEEN-MMI-AND-WEMWBS-SCORES-Using-R

An evaluation of the outliers on the key variables MMI Score and WEMWBS was carried 
before undertaking any descriptive statics. 
H1: There will be a statistically significant relationship between MMI score and WEMWB Outliers were investigated in each of the two datasets.

According to the findings, those who have good mental health are also low media multitaskers who focus on one 
task at a time, whereas high media multitaskers have poor mental health. Yet, the study 
provides no evidence that being a high media multitasker causes worse mental health or that 
having a lower mental wellbeing causes someone to become a high media multitasker.

Conclusion:
The study clearly reveals that MMI and WEMBS are inversely proportionate, implying that 
high media multitaskers have a negative impact on their mental health, whereas low 
media multitaskers have a positive effect.
